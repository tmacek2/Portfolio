##  Tyler Macek's Portfolio
This is a compliation of some of my personal data analsts projects, including some code, images, and files.  

### Project: Bellabeat Case Analysis (Google Data Analyst Certicate Project)
**Background:** The goal of this project was to clean, analyze, and report on data in the public [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).  This analysis would be presented to the head of markeing to direct future marketing directives for a single product line.   

**Analysis:** Tools used for analysis were Excel and R Studio. Due to the small nature of the data set, Excel was the best tool for the job of cleaning.  The analysis was done in R for practice.
