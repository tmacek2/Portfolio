#  Tyler Macek's Portfolio
This is a compliation of some of my personal data analsts projects, including some code, images, and files.  

## Project: Bellabeat Case Analysis (Google Data Analyst Certicate Project)
The goal of this project was to analyze data in the public [Kagle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) and provide insights to the head of markeing for Bellabeat. 

### Data - Cleaning and Analysis
The data in this project was in different csv files, to begin cleaning and organzing the data was necessary. 

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/tmacek2/Portfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
